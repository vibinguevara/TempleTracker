    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>
        Temple Tracker aims to bridge the gap between communities and local temples. In an era where technology connects everything, many small temples remain digitally invisible.
        <br /><br /> Our mission is to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Digitally map every temple â€” known and unknown.</li>
        <li>Preserve the history and cultural heritage of ancient temples.</li>
        <li>Empower devotees to share poojas, events, and temple stories.</li>
        <li>Encourage community gatherings and religious harmony.</li>
        <li>Protect temple lands from encroachment by transparent data tracking.</li>
    </ul>
